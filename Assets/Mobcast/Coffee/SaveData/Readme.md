## Requirement

* Unity 5.3+ *(included Unity 2017.x)*
* No other SDK are required



## Usage

1. Download [SaveData.unitypackage](https://github.com/mob-sakai/SaveData/master/SaveData.unitypackage) and install to your project.
1. 
1. Enjoy!

Use `YourSaveData` from code as follows.

```csharp
// Initialize and desplay current data.
// current data is loaded automatically.
YourSaveData.Initialize();
Debug.LogFormat("Current: {0}, {1}", YourSaveData.current.uniqueId, YourSaveData.current.sampleValue);

// Create new data.
YourSaveData.CreateEntity( "<uniqueId>" );
YourSaveData.current.sampleValue = 100;

// Change value and save.
YourSaveData.current.sampleValue = 200;
YourSaveData.SaveEntity();

// Load other data with id.
YourSaveData.LoadEntity( "<otherId>" );
Debug.LogFormat("Current: {0}, {1}", YourSaveData.current.uniqueId, YourSaveData.current.sampleValue);
```



## Multiple Environment?

In game development, not only **Production** environment but also **Development** environment is necessary.  
Database, API server, executable binary, file server, application ID, provisioning profile ... and *save data*.  
For example, like this.

* Development environment: data "Tommy" is exist in DB.
* Production environment: data "John" is exist in DB.

Probably, accessing the production environment with data "Tommy" will fail.  
There is no dataã€€"Tommy" in the production environment.  

The SaveData class has a `path` property which indicates the save data save path.  
By using `path`, save data can be created for each environment.
```csharp
#if DEVELOP
const string PATH = "YourSaveDataPath_develop";
#else
const string PATH = "YourSaveDataPath";
#endif

public override string path { get { return PATH; } }
```
